    <p>GitHub is a platform for hosting and managing code using **Git**, a version control system. It allows developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and manage versions of their code efficiently.

        ### Key Features of GitHub:
        1. **Version Control** – Tracks changes in code, making it easy to revert to previous versions.
        2. **Collaboration** – Multiple developers can work on the same project using branches and pull requests.
        3. **Repositories (Repos)** – Stores project files and their history.
        4. **Issues & Project Management** – Helps track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
        5. **GitHub Actions** – Automates workflows like testing and deployment.
        6. **Open Source Community** – Many open-source projects are hosted on GitHub, allowing contributions from developers worldwide.
        
        It is widely used in software development, from personal projects to enterprise-level applications. Do you want help setting up a GitHub repository or understanding how to use Git commands?</p>
